I am <em class="highlight">Thomas Ryan</em>, a recent graduate at the <em class="highlight">University of Sydney studying a bachelor of computing majoring in Software Development</em>. I have an interest in full-stack development, and creating robust solutions to complex business requirements using instinctive strong problem-solving skills. I am an effective communicator who thrives when developing in collaborative environments or translating complex ideas for key stakeholders. </span> <span class="paragraph"> I graduated highschool at St Patricks College, Sutherland in 2020 but it wasn't until my first year of University that I wrote my first line of code, and since then <em class="highlight">I haven't wanted to stop</em>. However, when I do stop you'll find me either serving beers to the locals in Darlington, catching up with my friends and family, gaming with mates or learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitzu </span> <span class="paragraph"> It is difficult to remember a time where I haven't been absolutely fascinated by tech. It probably started when I was a boy playing Pok√©mon but it has grown to be apart of who I am. I feel so fortunate to be able to apply myself to an industry that I feel passionate about. </span> </p> </section> <section id="where-does-my-passion-come-from" class="about-section"> <h1 class="about-heading">Why am I passionate about software development?</h1> <p class="about-text"> <span class="paragraph"> Software development combines several areas of life which fulfill me - <em class="highlight">problem solving, creativity, community, and the ever-evolving nature of the field</em> - into one productive outlet. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Software enables me to bring <em class="highlight">complex ideas to life, by assembling simple building blocks, into a cohesive and functional whole</em> . I find it immensely satisfying to create something tangible from a vision in my mind, using only a computer, time and knowledge. When a challenging function presents itself, nothing beats the feeling when I get it working after hours of research. </span>  <span class="paragraph"> I believe that the software development <em class="highlight">community is truly unique and fosters my passion for the field. </em> I value its open-source nature, which allows for the sharing of knowledge and tools freely. It's inspiring that many of the best software development tools are available for free, which is a testament to the collaborative and supportive culture of the community. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Finally, software development is a field that is constantly evolving in response to the ever-changing technology around us. To keep up with the latest tools and create cutting edge software, I will need to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. <em class="highlight">This lifelong learning makes software development an exciting and never ending journey to me.</em> By embracing the challenges of staying relevant in this dynamic field, I believe I will be offered endless opportunities for personal and professional growth. </span> </p> </section> </div> <a href="/index.html" class="back-slide"> <i class="about-arrow fa-angles-left fa-solid"></i> </a> </main> </body></html>
