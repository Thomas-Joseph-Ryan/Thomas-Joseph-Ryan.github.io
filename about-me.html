I am a student at the <em class="highlight">University of Sydney studying a bachelor of advanced computing majoring in Software Development</em>. Being in my penultimate year of study I would love to land an internship with your company! </span> <span class="paragraph"> I graduated highschool at St Patricks College, Sutherland in 2020 but it wasn't until my first year of University that I wrote my first line of code, and since then <em class="highlight">I haven't wanted to stop</em>. However, when I do stop you'll find me either serving beers to the locals in Darlington, catching up with my friends and family, gaming with mates or slowly making my way through great tv shows (its been about 1 year since ive started Game of Thrones.. im nearly on the last season). </span> <span class="paragraph"> It is difficult to remember a time in my 19 years on this earth where I haven't been absolutely fascinated by tech. It probably started when I was a boy playing Pok√©mon but it has grown to be apart of who I am. I feel so fortunate to be able to apply myself to an industry that I feel passionate about. </span> </p> </section> <section id="where-does-my-passion-come-from" class="about-section"> <h1 class="about-heading">Why am I passionate about software development?</h1> <p class="about-text"> <span class="paragraph"> Software development combines several areas of life which fulfill me - <em class="highlight">problem solving, creativity, community, and the ever-evolving nature of the field</em> - into one productive outlet. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Software enables me to bring <em class="highlight">complex ideas to life, by assembling simple building blocks, into a cohesive and functional whole</em> . I find it immensely satisfying to create something tangible from a vision in my mind, using only a computer, time and knowledge. Generally this comes naturally to me, however when a challenging function presents itself, nothing beats the feeling when I get it working after hours of research. </span> <span class="paragraph"> I see software development as a unique creative outlet because it allows me to try out new ideas with minimal risk. If something doesn't work, I can pivot and adjust without causing lasting damage to my project. </span> <span class="paragraph"> I believe that the software development <em class="highlight">community is truly unique and fosters my passion for the field. </em> I am proud to be studying it because of its open-source nature, which allows for the sharing of knowledge and tools freely. It's inspiring that many of the best software development tools are available for free, which is a testament to the collaborative and supportive culture of the community. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Finally, software development is a field that is constantly evolving in response to the ever-changing technology around us. To keep up with the latest tools and create cutting edge software, I will need to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. <em class="highlight">This lifelong learning makes software development an exciting and never ending journey to me.</em> By embracing the challenges of staying relevent in this dynamic field, I believe I will be offered endless opportunities for personal and professional growth. </span> </p> </section> </div> <a href="/index.html" class="back-slide"> <i class="about-arrow fa-angles-left fa-solid"></i> </a> </main> </body></html>
