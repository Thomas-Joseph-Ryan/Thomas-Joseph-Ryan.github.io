I am a student at the <em class="highlight">University of Sydney studying a bachelor of advanced computing majoring in Software Development</em>. I am currently in my penultimate year of study and would love to land an internship with your company! </span> <span class="paragraph"> I graduated highschool at St Patricks College, Sutherland in 2020 but it wasn't until my first year of University where I wrote my first line of code, and since then <em class="highlight">I haven't wanted to stop</em>. However, when I do stop you'll find me either serving beers to the locals in Darlington, catching up with my friends and family, gaming with some mates or slowly getting through some great tv shows (its been about 1 year since ive started Game of Thrones.. im nearly on the last season). </span> <span class="paragraph"> I can't remember a point in my 19 years on this earth where I haven't been absolutely fascinated by tech. It probably started when I was a boy playing Pok√©mon but it has grown to be apart of who I am, and I feel so fortunate to be able to apply myself to an industry that I feel passionate about. </span> </p> </section> <section id="where-does-my-passion-come-from" class="about-section"> <h1 class="about-heading">Why am I passionate about software development?</h1> <p class="about-text"> <span class="paragraph"> Software development combines several aspects of life which fulfill me - <em class="highlight">problem solving, creativity, community, and the ever-evolving nature of the field</em> - into a productive outlet. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Software enables me to bring <em class="highlight">complex ideas to life, by assembling simple building blocks, into a cohesive and functional whole</em> . I find it immensely satisfying to create something tangible from a vision in my mind, using only a computer, time and knowledge. This is something that is challenging and rewarding for me, as there are not many things that feel as good as when you finally get a function working after hours of research and trial and error. </span> <span class="paragraph"> For me, software development provides a unique outlet for creativity in my opinion, since there is a relatively small investment into new ideas, I can try new things knowing that if it goes wrong, it wont have any lasting impact on my project. Due to this, the cost of failure is low, allowing me to pivot and change course as needed until I achieve the best possible outcome. </span> <span class="paragraph"> The community around software development fosters my passion as I think it is truely something special. I may be wrong, but I don't know of many fields where so much knowledge is shared for the sake of creativity and productivity. Most of the best tools in software development are free and open source, you can get detailed help from others for free on websites like stack overflow , and most importantly, everything that you could want to do or learn in software development is free. <em class="highlight">The open source nature of this field makes me proud to be studying it</em>, as I believe everyone deserves a chance to learn everything there is to know about a subject if they apply themselves. </span> <span class="paragraph"> Finally, Software Development is a field necessitated by the technology around it. As the technology around us becomes more complex, so do the tools that software developers use in order to create cutting-edge software. This means that the knowledge needed for me to stay relevent in the field is forever changing, creating a constant need to learn new things. This to me makes software development a potentially life-long interest, as I will always be able to find something new to ensure that my passion does not get stale. <em class="highlight">I haven't stopped learning something new since I was born, and I don't intend on stopping once I finish university.</em> </span> </p> </section> </div> <a href="/index.html" class="back-slide"> <i class="about-arrow fa-angles-left fa-solid"></i> </a> </main> </body></html>
